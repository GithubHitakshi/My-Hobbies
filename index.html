        Writing, I like writing abou nature, youth etc. Writing is one of the most important thing as it helps us to recollect our history, help us to know about the world etc. I have participated in many writing competitions and I liked it a lot. Writing is incomplete without reading, so my favroite book is "Girl power" because it includes important writing skills.
